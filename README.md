# Company System :factory: :coffee:

Application created using Java OOP concepts:
+ Abstraction
+ Encapsulation
+ Inheritance
+ Polymorphism

### Abstraction

<div>
    <p>Abstraction is used to simplify objects in such a way that only their characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that are relevant to the system are represented.</p>
    <p>In the application in question, we have the example of a Employee. A real-world employee has various characteristics, but only the characteristics: name and payment are relevant to the system.</p>
</div>

### Encapsulation
<div>
     <p>Encapsulation was used in the application so that attributes, for example, cannot be accessed publicly.</p>
     <p>The Manager class, for example, implements the abstract Employee class and receives its methods. Therefore, we cannot access the methods of the Employee class directly, only through the Manager class.</p>
</div>

### Inheritance
 
<div>
    <p>The Operator class inherits characteristics from the Employee class.</p>
    <p>The concept of inheritance was applied such that the child class Operator has an explicit constructor taking parameters name and payment, additionally, it uses the super keyword and adds hourlyRate and hoursWorked to the Operator.</p>
</div>
  
### Polymorphism

<div>
    <p>The use of polymorphism was implemented through the Operator and Manager classes. Employee exhibits various forms; for example, the constructor method in the Operator class adds hourlyRate and hoursWorked, whereas in the Manager class it adds kpi and level.</p>
</div>
